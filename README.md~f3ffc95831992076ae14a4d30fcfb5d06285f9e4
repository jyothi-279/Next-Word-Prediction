# Next-Word-Prediction
This project implements a Next-Word Prediction system using LSTM neural networks. Trained on the "Pride and Prejudice" text, it predicts the next word in a sequence. Built in Jupyter Notebook and Python, the model demonstrates LSTM's potential for language modeling and text generation tasks.
